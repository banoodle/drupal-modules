Banoodle Widgets allows you to add accordions widgets to your ckeditor rich text tool bar. This makes it easy for content editors to insert accordions in entity content fields.

This module requires the ckeditor module and that the ckeditor library be installed in the sites/all/libraries directory of your site.

Important: you must do a custom "build" download so you can add the "widgets" plugin which is required for this module to work (http://ckeditor.com/builder).

After installation of the module and required library, you will need to enable the new toolbar button for accordions for each ckeditor profile (e.g., Full, Advanced) at admin/config/content/ckeditor/edit - the settings are under "Editor Appearance"
